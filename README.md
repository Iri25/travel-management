Application for travel management

A travel agency organizes trips and they need an application to manage their transportation problem. The means of transport available are the plane and the bus. A plane trip is characterized by travel code, departure city, destination city, departure date, property to stop or not, total number of seats and number of reserved seats. A bus trip is characterized by travel code, departure city, destination city, departure date, number of days of travel duration, total number of seats and number of reserved seats.

The application must allow the following functionalities:
1. Login - After successful authentication, all trips are displayed, along with their related features
2. Operation - After successful authentication, a user can:
• Look for trips that take place on a certain date. The application will display all the characteristics of the search results.
• Book a certain number of seats for a trip with a given code. A user cannot book more seats than available for that trip. After the change, the application displays the updated travel list. If a certain trip no longer has any space available, then it will be displayed with special fonts.
3. Logout
